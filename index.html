Welcome to my blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah and I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented towards Data Science. 
This past year, I have been mostly implementing my projects with Python and various Machine Learning / Viusalization libraries. I am also familiar with Object Oriented Programming and HTML/CSS.

I created this blog for two main reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio which showcase different projects that I have been working.</li>
<li> For publishing mini articles which explain Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts. Documenting what I know in my own words helps me understand the subject better.
 I hope you find this blog useful!</li>
</ul>
