I created this blog for various reasons:
<ul>
<li> Its a portfolio to showcase different ML/Visualization projects that I have been working on.</li>
<li> To publish mini articles on Machine Learning. I find documenting what I know in my own words usually helps me understand the subject better. So
I hope you find this blog useful!</li>
<li>To share some of my experiences, other interests and hobbies. And trust me..... I have a lot :) 

 <h3>Things I'm currently working on:<h3>
 
<h3>Youtube - MachineThree </h3>
I have recently created a Youtube Channel Called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3r-YDqZvxrTXhARTQrGhA">MachineThree</a>. The aim of this channel is to explain machine learning topics in an engaging way.
Feel free to subscribe and give me some feedback as I am always dedicated to improving my content!
<h3> Digital Art </h3>
Digital art has been a strong interest of mine for a long time now. I admit I haven't been practicing as much as I wanted to the past few years, but I recently decided to pick up the pen again! Well, 
technically its an Ipad pencil :). I am currently using procreate which is very easy to use. You can view some of my art work on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/otusflow/gallery">Ko-fi</a>
or purchase some of my digital designs from my <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/ma649/explore?asc=u&page=1&sortOrder=recent">Redbubble store</a>.
You can also follow on me on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/otusflow_illustration">instagram page</a> where I upload my digital art work everyday.
 
<h3> Language Learning - Swedish </h3>
Language learning has been a part of my life since I was 10 years old. I think it changes your perception in many ways. 
Although I got into the habit of starting and quitting languages, I took a lot of interest in Swedish in 2017. Since then, I have been practicing
 and have made some good progress especially this past year. The key is consistency and never giving up!
