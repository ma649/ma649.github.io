Welcome to my blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah. I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented towards Data Science. 
This past year, I have been mostly implementing my projects with Python and various Machine Learning / Viusalization libraries. I am also familiar with Object Oriented Programming and HTML/CSS. Check out

<br>
I created this blog mainly for two reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio that showcases different projects that I have been working.</li>
<li> For publishing mini articles that explain Machine Learning concepts. Documenting what I know in my own words helps me understand the subject better.
 I hope you find this blog useful!</li>
</ul><br>
I have also recently created a Youtube Channel Called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3r-YDqZvxrTXhARTQrGhA">MachineThree</a> where I explain machine learning concepts in more detail!
I would appreciate it if you could subscribe and provide feedback as I am always dedicated to improving my content!
