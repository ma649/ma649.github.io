I created this blog for 2 main reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio to showcase projects that I have worked on and articles I wrote.</li>
<li> Documenting what I know in my own format helps me understand the subject better! If you are reading this, I hope you find this blog useful in someway.</li>
</ul>
