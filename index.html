Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah and I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented towards Data Science. 
This past year, I have been mostly implementing my projects with Python and various Machine Learning / Viusalization libraries. I am also familiar with Object Oriented Programming and HTML/CSS.

<br>
I created this blog for two reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio to showcase projects that I have been working on in various areas.</li>
<li> Publish mini articles which explain Machine Learning concepts. Documenting what I know in my own format helps me understand the subject better.
 If you are reading this, I hope you find this blog useful in someway or another!.</li>
</ul>
