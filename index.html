<br>
Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah and I am from Saudi Arabia, Jeddah to be percise ;).  I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented mainly towards Data Science, a deep passion of mine. 
This past year, I have been mostly implementing projects with Python and various Machine Learning / Viusalization libraries, some of which you can view <a href="https://ma649.github.io/projects/">here</a>. If you would like to 
know more about me, take a look at my LinknedIn profile below!

<br>
I created this blog mainly for various reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio that showcases different ML/Visualization projects that I have been working on.</li>
<li> For publishing mini articles that explain Machine Learning concepts. Documenting what I know in my own words helps me understand the subject better.
 I hope you find this blog useful!</li>
<li> Talk about my experiences, other intereests and hobbies!

I have also recently created a Youtube Channel Called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3r-YDqZvxrTXhARTQrGhA">MachineThree</a>. I create videos that explain machine learning concepts in a simple and engaging way.
I would appreciate it if you could subscribe and provide feedback as I am always dedicated to improving my content!
