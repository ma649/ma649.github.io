<p style="font-size:0.6em">Current status: Masters in Advanced Computer Science.</p>

Welcome to my personal blog! I am a recent Masters graduate from Swansea University in Advanced Computer Science and specialize in Data Science.
<br>
I created this blog for 2 main reasons:
1. It serves as a portfolio to showcase projects that I have worked on and articles I wrote. 
2. Documenting what I know in my own format helps me understand the subject better!
