Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah and I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented towards Data Science. 
I have been mostly implementing my projects with Python and various Machine Learning/Viusalization libraries the past year but also familiar with Object Oriented Programming.

I created this blog for a few reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio to showcase projects that I have worked on / currently working on.</li>
<li> Publish mini articles which explain ML/DL concepts</li>
<li> Documenting what I know in my own format helps me understand the subject better. If you are reading this, I hope you find this blog useful in someway or another!.</li>
</ul>
