Welcome to my personal blog! My name is Mohammad Althegah and I am from Saudi Arabia, Jeddah to be percise ;).  I am a Masters graduate in Advanced Computer Science from Swansea University. My study is oriented mainly towards Data Science, a deep passion of mine. 
This past year, I have been mostly implementing projects with Python and various Machine Learning / Viusalization libraries, some of which you can view <a href="https://ma649.github.io/projects/">here</a>. If you would like to 
know more about me, take a look at my LinknedIn profile below!

 <a class="LI-simple-link" href='https://sa.linkedin.com/in/mohammad-althegah?trk=profile-badge'>Mohammad Althegah</a></div>
<br>
I created this blog for various reasons:
<ul>
<li> It serves as a portfolio that showcases different ML/Visualization projects that I have been working on.</li>
<li> For publishing mini articles that explain Machine Learning concepts. Documenting what I know in my own words helps me understand the subject better. So
i hope you find this blog useful!</li>
<li> Talk about my experiences, other interests and hobbies!
</ul><br>
One of my main hobbies is digital art which I have started to take serious recently! I am currently drawing on my ipad using procreate. You can view some of my art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3r-YDqZvxrTXhARTQrGhA">here</a>
or even purchase some of my designs from my <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/ma649/explore?asc=u&page=1&sortOrder=recent">redbubble store</a>.
<br clear="all" /><br/>
I have also recently created a Youtube Channel Called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3r-YDqZvxrTXhARTQrGhA">MachineThree</a>. In this channnel I try to create videos that explain machine learning concepts in a simple and engaging way.
I would appreciate it if you could subscribe and provide feedback as I am always dedicated to improving my content!
