Abstract 

Recent success of statistical analysis and machine learning tools in the

healthcare domain has prompted research into various areas of epidemi-
ology such as Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). Several obstacles however

arise when dealing with large heterogeneous data such as bias, missing in-
formation and generalizability. To tackle these issues, we propose a five

layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) using a Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) optimizer to predict patients with cardiovascular disease using the
NHANES datasets on various sample sizes. We also incorporate Pearson
correlation and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to assess its usability
as a feature selection approach. Training our network on 146 features, our
optimum results are achieved on a sample size of 3,393 (2:1 class ratio) with
a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 88%. These results were optimized

using a learning rate of Î· 0.01 and dropout rates of 0.3 and 0.6 respec-
tively. This shows that our proposed method can obtain modest results

when trained on small datasets. However, as the sample size increases, our
DNN is unable to generalize and progressively obtains worse recall rates.
