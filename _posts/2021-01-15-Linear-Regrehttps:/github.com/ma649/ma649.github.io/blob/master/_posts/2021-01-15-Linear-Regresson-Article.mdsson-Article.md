# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is an important introductary topic for those who are starting to get into machine learning / statistics. 
Understanding the main concept behind it is essential as it will allow you to transition into other complex algorithms. Linear Regression falls under 
Supervised Learning. This means we are provided with the input and output values, and we try to predict an outcome based on this information. As the name suggests,
Linear regression is a form of regression analysis (as opposed to Classification). In this instance, we are trying to predict a continious variable.


The goal of linear regression is simple, we aim to draw the line of best fit.


We have an X-axis and a Y-Axis, and a bunch of data. 
```python
